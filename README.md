# Text-To-Speech-voice-cloning
Fine tuning SpeechT5 (TTS pretrained model) on a new language.
This repository contains a comprehensive notebook demonstrating text-to-speech synthesis using a fine-tuned SpeechT5 model. The notebook provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to training and testing a text-to-speech (TTS) model on a custom dataset. Below is a summary of the key steps and features.

# Features:
-Model: SpeechT5 model from Hugging Face, fine-tuned for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.
-Custom Dataset Support: The notebook is designed to support fine-tuning on custom datasets, including the ability to fine-tune the model on personal voice data.
-Manual Implementation: The project avoids any reliance on black-box cloning libraries. Every part of the pipeline is manually implemented, providing complete transparency and control over the process.
-Detailed Explanations: Every section of the notebook includes detailed documentation to ensure clarity, enabling users to follow, understand, and adapt the model to their own needs.
-Training Process: The notebook includes key steps such as data preparation, text normalization, speaker embedding extraction, and training to minimize loss, all with robust tracking and logging.
# Conclusion:
This project achieves impressive voice synthesis results. The manual approach ensures full control over the entire pipeline, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases.
